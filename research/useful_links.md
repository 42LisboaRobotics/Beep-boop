From page 14 there is a really cool article on how to build a robot with a pi, it could be useful to figure out what is needed to build our rover.

Ok, I found this channel https://www.youtube.com/c/mcwhorpj/featured and it seems to be just amazing.

The first video I saw was this, which by the way, seems to be a giant meme (from the 1min long intro with a "human-robot" dancing to the list of why robots > humans) until min 10, where it actually starts getting pretty good.

This dude has several series that teach how to build robots for beginners. One that he highly recommends is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqXQ80vlgqE

Unfortunately he doesn't have a playlist for these series but I believe it is quite easy to find the following episodes.

I've seen some comments that saying he is "like the Bob Ross of robotics" and that is a major compliment, if you ask me.

Let me know what you guys think

:tired_face:

This website also shows  some interesting options https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=robotics

Whenever I get to my pc I will look better
